* 4 oz jar **diced pimentos** *(drained)*
* 1⁄4 cup **flour**
* 3⁄4 cup **half and half**
* 32 oz **chicken broth**

* 1⁄2 cup frozen **peas**
* 1 **bay leaf**
* 1⁄4 tsp **black peppercorns**
* 1⁄4 tsp **ground mustard**
* **salt**
* **pepper**

Instructions

1. In a separate pot over medium heat, bring the **chicken broth**, **bay leaf** and **peppercorns** to a boil. Add the chicken breasts, cover the pot, and lower the heat to a simmer. Poach for about 12 to 15 minutes.
1. Prepare a separate large pot of salted water and begin bringing to a boil.
1. After the chicken is cooked through, remove from the pot and dice. Reserve 2 cups of the poaching liquid and empty the pot.
1. In the pot used for the chicken, melt **2 Tbsp butter** over medium heat. Sautee the **onions** and **mushrooms** until tender, ~5 mins. Remove vegetables and set aside.
1. Melt **4 Tbsp butter** in pot. Whisk in the **flour** to make a roux, whisking constantly for ~2 minutes.
1. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup of the **poaching liquid**. The mixture will get thick immediately. Slowly pour in 1 additional cup of the poaching liquid, whisking constantly. A sauce will start to form. Slowly whisk in the **half and half**.
1. Turn heat to low and cook sauce for ~5 minutes, stirring frequently. Mix in **ground mustard**. Add **salt** and **pepper** to taste.
1. While the sauce cooks, add the **egg noodles** to the other pot and cook until al dente. Drain.
1. Add the **cooked vegetables**, **diced chicken**, **diced, drained pimentos**, and **frozen peas** to the sauce and mix to combine. If the mixture is too thick, add more of the poaching liquid until desired consistency. Cover and cook for ~2 minutes.
1. Lightly butter the egg noodles and serve the sauce over them.
