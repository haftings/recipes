Ingredients

- 2/3 lbs (~11oz) **spaghetti**
- 1 **lemon**
- 1 oz **Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese** *(grated)*
- 1 clove **garlic** *(minced)*
- 4 tbsp **butter**
- **salt**
- **black pepper**
- **parsley** *(optional, to taste)*

Instructions

1. Zest **lemon**, mince **garlic**, and grate **cheese**

1. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring and tossing to coat, until pasta is glazed in a satiny, emulsified sauce
