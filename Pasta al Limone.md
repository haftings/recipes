- 1 lb **spaghetti**
- 1 **lemon**
- 1 oz **Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese** *(grated)*
- 1 clove **garlic** *(minced)*
- 5 tbsp **butter**
- **salt**
- **black pepper**

1. Zest **lemon** and mince **garlic**.
1. Boil **spaghetti** in salted water until slightly less than al dente, ~8 minutes. Reserve ~1 cup of pasta water before draining.
1. Melt **butter** over medium heat until foaming. Lower heat to low, add **lemon zest** and **garlic**, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
1. Add spaghetti to butter mixture, along with 1/2 cup reserved pasta water. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring and tossing to coat, until pasta is glazed in a satiny, emulsified sauce. 
1. Add grated cheese and toss and stir rapidly until sauce thickens; if it becomes too tight and dry at any time, add more pasta-cooking water to loosen it sufficiently. 
1. Add lemon juice until desired tartness is reached (~1/2 lemon).
1. Season with **black pepper** and kosher **salt** to taste.
1. Serve, optionally topped with additional grated cheese, lemon zest, and any remaining lemon wedges for squeezing.
